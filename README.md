# Shortest Path Algorithms - Graph Analysis with Python

This project demonstrates the application of two popular pathfinding algorithms ‚Äî **Dijkstra's Algorithm** and **A\*** (A-star) ‚Äî to compute the shortest path in a weighted undirected graph. 
The analysis is based on a visual representation of a network, where each node and edge represents a possible connection and cost.

## üìÅ Files Included

- `Marco_AI_CA2.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing Dijkstra's and A* algorithms with step-by-step logic and output.
- `graph1.PNG`: Original graph used for pathfinding.
- `shortest_path.PNG`: Visualization of the shortest path found using Dijkstra's or A*.
- `Distance_C.PNG`, `Distance_G.PNG`, `Distance_L.PNG`, `Distance_N.PNG`, `Distance_S.PNG`: Step-by-step screenshots showing updates to distance estimates.
- `c52ae0e9-4c97-4420-ad51-ee0af21fe1b8.png`: Final result or path representation.

## üîç What This Project Does

- Parses a weighted graph from an image.
- Implements:
  - **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**: Explores all possible paths using greedy selection.
  - **A\*** (A-star) Algorithm: Uses both actual distance and heuristic (estimated cost to goal) to guide the search more efficiently.
- Uses visual aids to highlight how distances and paths are updated in each step.
- Outputs the final shortest path and its total cost.

## üìå Key Concepts

- **Graph traversal**
- **Greedy algorithms**
- **Heuristic search**
- **Priority Queue (for node selection)**
- **Data visualization for learning and explanation**
